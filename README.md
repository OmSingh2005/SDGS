This page showcase data over our research and survey in LPU university.
We have survey around 140-150 students in the university regarding the evaluation and Problems of Solid Waste Management.
The research contains Key Points of survey, Gallery, Data representations, Interactive Quiz, and our conclusions.
Our second survey ,on JRC army cantt locality,concludes that people at home are pretty good at handling their waste and recycling every day.
The community uses parks well and manages to throw away the trash generated daily. When it comes to air quality and environmental worries, people have general concerns in the Army Cantt area.
After parties and events, both individuals and the community do a good job of managing waste, especially after Diwali. People are also doing a great job with composting, using small gardens and farmland.
They are also recycling things like metal, glass, plastic, old items, and paper regularly through collectors or special places, like every week or month.
Overall, the survey tells us that the community is doing well in taking care of the environment and handling waste responsibly.
